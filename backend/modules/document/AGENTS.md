## Document Module

### What this module is

The document module stores uploaded files and their metadata. It owns physical storage orchestration through pluggable adapters and persists document records in the `document` schema.

### Domain scope

- Owned capabilities: upload documents, list documents, read document details, download document binaries, delete documents, choose configured storage backend, keep file metadata and ownership.
- Internal-only metadata: stored filenames remain persistence/storage details and must not be exposed through public API DTOs.
- Owned entities/value objects: `Document`, `DocumentDetails`, `DocumentStorageType`, storage adapter request contracts.
- Non-owned areas: user identity lifecycle, authorization rules implementation, frontend clients, cross-module business usage of documents.
- Boundary rules: the module only depends on `_common`; user ownership is stored as raw `UUID` and not as a JPA relation to the identity module.

### Core flows

1. Upload document
    - Trigger: authenticated user or admin sends multipart upload to `/documents` or `/admin/documents`.
    - Steps: resolve current user UUID, validate files, create document UUID, compute checksum, derive stored filename, store binary content through the configured adapter, persist metadata row.
    - Output: persisted `DocumentDetails` records for uploaded files.
    - Failure/edge cases: missing filename, empty file payload, missing storage adapter configuration, storage write failure, DB save failure after storage write triggers cleanup.
2. List user documents
    - Trigger: authenticated request to `/documents`.
    - Steps: resolve current user UUID, query only rows owned by that user, map entities to API DTOs.
    - Output: paged list of caller-owned documents.
    - Failure/edge cases: none beyond auth and pagination validation.
3. Read or download document
    - Trigger: authenticated request to `/documents/{documentId}` or `/documents/{documentId}/download`, or admin request to `/admin/documents/{documentId}` or `/admin/documents/{documentId}/download`.
    - Steps: resolve owner scope if needed, load metadata row, optionally load binary content through the matching adapter, return metadata or file response.
    - Output: `DocumentDetails` metadata or binary file content with inline PDF support.
    - Failure/edge cases: user access to another user's document returns `404`, missing document returns `404`, storage read failure aborts download.
4. Admin list and delete documents
    - Trigger: admin request to `/admin/documents` or `/admin/documents/{documentId}`.
    - Steps: query all documents for listing; on delete load metadata, remove binary content through the matching adapter, delete metadata row.
    - Output: paged list of all documents or successful deletion.
    - Failure/edge cases: deleting unknown document returns `404`, adapter mismatch or storage delete failure aborts metadata deletion.
5. User delete own document
    - Trigger: authenticated request to `/documents/{documentId}`.
    - Steps: resolve current user UUID, load row by document UUID and owner UUID, remove binary content, delete metadata row.
    - Output: successful deletion of caller-owned document.
    - Failure/edge cases: deleting another user's document returns `404`.

### Data ownership

- Schema(s): `document`
- Main tables/entities: `document.document`
- Audit/event tables: Not applicable because this module currently stores only document metadata and binary content references.

### Public API surface

- Controllers/routes: `UserDocumentController` on `/documents`, `AdminDocumentController` on `/admin/documents`, both exposing list, details, download, upload, and delete operations within their access scope
- Consumed events/commands: Not applicable
- Emitted events/commands: Not applicable
- Exposed facades/interfaces: `DocumentStorageAdapter` for internal storage implementations

### Integrations and dependencies

- Internal module dependencies: `_common` for auth utilities, base entities, and access annotations.
- External integrations: local filesystem and generic S3-compatible object storage.
- Communication style (event-driven or direct facade): direct internal service orchestration only; integration tests also consume identity-owned auth test configuration from the identity module test artifact.

### Class and Type Catalog

#### config

- `DocumentFlywayMigrationConfig`: registers Flyway migration module for the `document` schema.
- `DocumentProperties`: typed storage configuration for local and S3 adapters.

#### controller

- `AdminDocumentController`: admin API for list, upload private documents, and delete any document.
- `UserDocumentController`: authenticated API for upload, list, and delete of caller-owned documents.

#### service

- `DocumentService`: transaction boundary for document upload, listing, and deletion flows.

#### handler

- Not applicable because the module does not use command or event handlers.

#### repository

- `DocumentRepository`: JPA access for document metadata with admin and owner-scoped queries.

#### model/entity

- `Document`: persisted document metadata row with owner UUID, checksum, size, storage type, and stored filename.

#### model/dto|command|event

- `DocumentDetails`: API DTO for document metadata exposed to clients, excluding internal stored filename values.
- `DocumentContent`: service DTO for downloaded document payloads.
- `DocumentStorageType`: enum describing the active binary storage backend.
- `StoreDocumentRequest`: storage adapter command payload with owner UUID, stored filename, and file bytes.

#### shared contracts (if any)

- `DocumentStorageAdapter`: contract implemented by each binary storage adapter for store, load, and delete operations.

#### utils (if any)

- `DocumentMapper`: maps `Document` entities to `DocumentDetails` DTOs.

### Configuration

- `bitecode.document.storage.default-storage-type`: selects the adapter used for new uploads.
- `bitecode.document.storage.local.base-path`: writable filesystem base path for local storage.
- `bitecode.document.storage.s3.bucket`: S3-compatible bucket name used by the S3 adapter.
- `bitecode.document.storage.s3.region`: S3 region sent to the SDK.
- `bitecode.document.storage.s3.endpoint`: optional custom endpoint for AWS-compatible providers like DigitalOcean Spaces.
- `bitecode.document.storage.s3.access-key`: optional static access key for the S3 client.
- `bitecode.document.storage.s3.secret-key`: optional static secret key for the S3 client.
- `bitecode.document.storage.s3.force-path-style`: toggles path-style addressing for S3-compatible providers.
- Migration schema/location: `classpath:db/migration/document`

### Testing notes

- Main test classes: `DocumentControllerTest` in `src/test/integration` for admin and user endpoint coverage with local storage, `DocumentIntegrationTest` in `src/test/integration` for shared cleanup and test wiring, `S3DocumentStorageAdapterTest` in `src/test/unit` for mocked S3 adapter behavior.
- Must-cover scenarios: upload metadata persistence, owner scoping, admin access control, cleanup on delete, cleanup of local test storage between runs, and S3 object key generation plus bucket validation.
- Special setup: current integration tests use local storage only and require Docker/Testcontainers for PostgreSQL; S3 is covered by unit tests with mocked SDK behavior.

### Change log expectations

- Update this file whenever flows/domain/API/integrations/boundaries/classes materially change.
- Treat this update as required for module development.
